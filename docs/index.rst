Welcome to uframe's documentation!
==================================

As of today, uframe is still in development. It is a working prototype and planned features, bugfixes, tests and documentation are partly still missing.

uframe is a comprehensive Python package designed to simplify and expedite research involving uncertain data from various sources. By seamlessly integrating Probability Density Functions (PDFs) into its core functionality, uframe empowers users to manipulate and analyze uncertain data with ease.

Key Features:

    Flexible Data Handling: uframe offers a versatile framework for working with uncertain data, enabling researchers to tackle complex datasets efficiently.
    Probability Density Functions (PDFs): uframe leverages PDFs as the fundamental representation of attribute uncertainty, allowing for a comprehensive characterization of uncertainty within each instance.
    Streamlined Research: With its user-friendly interface and powerful capabilities, uframe facilitates seamless data exploration, analysis, and visualization, promoting accelerated research and insights.

Whether you're dealing with incomplete or imprecise measurements, or simply need a reliable tool to handle uncertainty, uframe provides a robust foundation for your uncertain data analysis needs.
